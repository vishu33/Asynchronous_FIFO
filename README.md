# Asynchronous_FIFO
This repositry conetains the Verilog Design of Asynchrounous Dual Clock FIFO.
An Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a type of digital circuit that facilitates data storage and transfer between two asynchronous clock domains. It is commonly used in digital systems where data needs to be transferred between different clock domains or between systems with different timing characteristics. The theory behind an asynchronous FIFO involves managing data transfer, addressing potential timing differences, and ensuring data integrity. Here are the key concepts:
